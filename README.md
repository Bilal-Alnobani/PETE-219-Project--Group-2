Group Members: 1) Bilal Alnobani  2)Ahmed Fattouh  3) Ramsagar  4) Mohammed Al-Hadad 

The objective of this project was to clean, visualize and analyze well log data, poro-perm data and a cross-section of the reservoir.
All of these were done using python and the code will be shown in a separate file for each data set as it makes it easier to visualize each data set on its own.
The .CSV files will also be uploaded for reference. 
Different methods and ways were used to visualize this dataset.
